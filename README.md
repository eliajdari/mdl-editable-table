# mdl-editable-table
Material Design Lite editable table

  Based on HTML5 Editable Table (https://codepen.io/ashblue/pen/mCtuA) by @ashblue 

  It doesn't use a table id (as the original source) but a css selector, so more tables can be defined in the same page. 
  There are no move up/down buttons because it's more like an spreadsheet.
